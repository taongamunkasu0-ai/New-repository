## Question 2:  HTML elements 
### 1.  Challenging elements 
The 5 elements that were challenging to implement are:
* 'form': Requires handling user input and validation.
* 'nav': Needs proper linking and structuring for navigation.
* 'img': Ensuring images are properly sized,formatted and accessible.
* 'header': Creating a visually appealing and functional header section.
* 'meta': Understanding various meta tags for SEO and responsiveness.
### 2. Semantic elements usage
The semantic elements used are:
* 'header': Defined the header section of te website,which includes the navigation and introduction.
*  'nav': Defined the navigation links within the header section.
*   'main': Defined the main content section of the website ,which includes the "About Me" and "Get in Touch" sections.
*   'section': Defined individual sections within the main content area, such as "About Me" and "Get in Touch".
*   'footer': Defined the footer section of the website,which includes copyright information.
### 3.  Most useful element for layout 
The 'section' element was useful for organizing the layout because it helps divide content into thematic sections like "About Me" and "Contact"
## Question 3:  HTML Attributes 
### 1.  Essential attributes 
Three essential attributes for functionality are:
* 'src': Used in 'img' for image source.
*  'href': Used in 'a' for links.
*  'alt': Provides image description for accessibility.
### 2.  Class vs id
'class' and 'id' attributes were not extensively used in this code. Generally, 'class' applies styles to multiple elements, while 'id' targets a unique element.
### 3.  Attribute improving user experience
The 'alt' attribute improved user experience by providing text for screen readers or if images fail to load.
## 4.  Development Process 
### 1. Planning structure 
The website structure was planned with sections for header, about, contact, and footer , outlining content flow before coding.
### 2.  Testing & debugging HTML
HTML was tested using browser developer tools and validated with W3C Markup Validation Service for errors.
### 3.  Challenges & solutions 
Challenges included styling and layout; solved using CSS styling and semantic HTML for better structure.
##  5.  Git & Github Implementation
### 1.  Git commands 
Git commands like  'git init', 'git add', 'git commit', and 'git push' would  beused for version control.
### 2.  Commits & message strategy 
Commits would have messages like "Add header" or "Implement contact form" for tracking changes.
### 3.  Version control inportance 
Version control is important for tracking changes and managing project updates efficiently.
## Qustion 6.  Code Quality & Best Practices
### 1. HTML validation 
HTML can be validated using W3C Markup Validation Service to ensure it's error-free.
### 2. Best practices
Best practices followed include using semantic HTML, proper indentation, and seperating content (HTML) and styling (CSS).
### 3. Improvement  with more time
